🎯 ACCESS CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
===============================================

✅ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:

1. 📊 ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
   - Users only see events they have access to
   - Access depends on user's role in each event:
     * Creator: Full control (created the event)
     * Moderator: Can moderate, edit event, add moderators
     * Participant: Can ask questions, vote (joined via link)
     * Admin: System-wide access to all events
     * No Access: Cannot see or interact with the event

2. 🔗 DUAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
   - Microsoft Entra ID: Enterprise users with microsoft_id
   - Manual Database: Users added by admins with email/password
   - auth_source field tracks authentication method

3. 🎪 EVENT ACCESS LOGIC
   - Users can only access events where they have a role
   - Event list shows only accessible events for each user
   - Role-specific permissions control what users can do

4. 📝 PERMISSION SYSTEM
   - can_view: Can see the event
   - can_ask_questions: Can post questions
   - can_vote: Can upvote questions
   - can_moderate: Can star/stage questions
   - can_edit_event: Can modify event details
   - can_delete_event: Can delete the event
   - can_add_moderators: Can add/remove moderators
   - view_type: 'user' or 'moderator' UI experience

5. 🔗 LINK-BASED JOINING
   - Share links: For general event sharing
   - Invite links: For private event invitations
   - Automatic participant assignment when joining via link

6. 🎨 FRONTEND INTEGRATION
   - EventCard shows user's role and permissions
   - Different UI based on user's role in each event
   - Join link pages for seamless event joining

🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Backend (Django):
- Updated User model with auth_source, get_accessible_events()
- Updated Event model with enhanced permission methods
- Modified views to filter events by user access
- Added join endpoints for share/invite links
- Enhanced serializers with permission fields

Frontend (Next.js):
- Updated Event type with permission fields
- Modified EventCard to show role-based information
- Added join link pages for event invitations
- Enhanced authentication context

Database:
- Added auth_source field to track authentication method
- All existing users migrated to appropriate auth_source

🧪 TESTING COMPLETED:
- Access control logic verified for all user roles
- Event creation and joining tested
- Permission system validated
- API endpoints tested with different users

🎯 USER EXPERIENCE:
- Each user sees personalized event dashboard
- Role-based UI shows appropriate actions
- Seamless event joining via links
- Clear permission indicators for each event

✅ SYSTEM IS READY FOR PRODUCTION
