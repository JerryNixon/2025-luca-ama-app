# Frontend Development Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
You now have a fully structured Next.js React frontend for your AMA (Ask Me Anything) application. The architecture is designed to support all three user personas (Moderator, Presenter, User) and implements the workflows described in your user stories.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### 1. **Clean Component Structure**
- **Pages**: App Router structure with login, events, and main dashboard
- **Components**: Reusable EventCard and QuestionCard components
- **Services**: API abstraction layer ready for Django backend integration
- **Types**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 2. **User Role System**
The application supports three distinct roles with appropriate permissions:
- **Moderator**: Full event management, question curation, and administration
- **Presenter**: Question management, marking answers, adding notes
- **User**: Question submission, upvoting, viewing discussions

### 3. **Demo Data Integration**
- Complete demo dataset with users, events, and questions
- Realistic data that matches your user stories
- Toggle switch to easily switch between demo and real API
