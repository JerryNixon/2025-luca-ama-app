# Supabase vs Microsoft Fabric - Developer Experience Comparison

## üéØ **Project Overview**
Compare Supabase (PostgreSQL + APIs) vs Microsoft Fabric SQL for AMA app development, focusing on:
- Developer experience and setup complexity
- Performance characteristics
- Feature completeness
- API capabilities (REST, GraphQL, Real-time)
- Development workflow efficiency

## üìã **Testing Methodology**

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup & Configuration**
- [ ] Create Supabase project and database
- [ ] Configure authentication
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Install Supabase CLI and dependencies

### **Phase 2: Database Migration & Schema**
- [ ] Migrate Django models to Supabase PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Configure database relationships
- [ ] Test database performance vs Fabric

### **Phase 3: API Testing & Integration**
- [ ] Test Supabase REST API auto-generation
- [ ] Implement GraphQL queries for AMA features
- [ ] Test real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Compare API performance with Django REST + Fabric

### **Phase 4: Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] Implement Supabase Auth
- [ ] Test social login providers
- [ ] Compare with current Microsoft authentication
- [ ] Test user management features

### **Phase 5: Real-time Features**
- [ ] Implement real-time question updates
- [ ] Test live voting functionality
- [ ] Compare real-time performance
- [ ] Evaluate WebSocket stability

### **Phase 6: Developer Experience Analysis**
- [ ] Document setup time and complexity
- [ ] Measure development velocity
- [ ] Evaluate debugging capabilities
- [ ] Compare documentation quality
- [ ] Test deployment and scaling

## üõ† **Technical Implementation Plan**

### **Supabase Features to Test:**
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic API generation
2. **Auth**: Built-in authentication with social providers
3. **Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions
4. **Storage**: File storage capabilities
5. **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions
6. **GraphQL**: Auto-generated GraphQL API
7. **Dashboard**: Web-based management interface

### **AMA App Features to Implement:**
- [ ] User registration and authentication
- [ ] Event creation and management
- [ ] Question submission and voting
- [ ] Real-time question feed
- [ ] Moderator controls
- [ ] File uploads (if applicable)
