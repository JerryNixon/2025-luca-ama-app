# üîß Events Not Showing - Debug Steps

## Issue Description
- Events can be created successfully
- Events are saved to the database (Django admin shows them)
- Events page shows "No events found" even though events exist

## üîç Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/events
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Look for these debug messages:
   - "Events page render - events: [array]"
   - "Fetching events from API..."
   - "EventService: Fetching events from API..."
   - "EventService: Raw response: [object]"
   - "Events fetched: [data]"

### 2. **Check Network Tab**
1. Open Network tab in developer tools
2. Go to events page
3. Look for:
   - GET request to `/api/events/`
   - Status should be 200
   - Response should contain events array

### 3. **Check API Response Format**
Look for one of these patterns in the console:

**Pattern A (Array format - DRF default):**
```
EventService: Using plain array format
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Event Name",
    "is_active": true,
    ...
  }
]
```

**Pattern B (Wrapped format):**
```
EventService: Using wrapped format
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid", 
      "name": "Event Name",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîß Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated EventService**
- Added debug logging to see API responses
- Added handling for both array and wrapped response formats
- Added error handling for invalid responses

### 2. **Updated Events Page**
- Added detailed error logging
- Added debug console output for state changes
- Fixed null checking for events array

### 3. **Fixed Type Mismatches**
- Updated Event interface to match backend field names
- Fixed EventCard component to use correct field names

## üéØ What to Look For

### If Events API is Working:
- Console should show: "Events fetched: [array with events]"
- Network tab should show 200 response with events data
- Events should appear on the page

### If Events API is Failing:
- Console should show error messages
- Network tab might show 401, 403, or 500 errors
- Error state should be displayed on page

### If Events Exist but Don't Show:
- Console might show "Events fetched: []" (empty array)
- This could mean query filters are excluding your events
- Check if user has permission to see the events they created

## üîç Additional Checks

### Django Admin Check:
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. Login with superuser credentials
3. Check if events exist in the database
4. Note which user created them
5. Check if the moderator user is the same one logging in

### API Test:
```bash
# Test events API directly
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "moderator@microsoft.com", "password": "moderator123"}'

# Use the token from login response
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## üìã Next Steps

1. **First**: Check browser console output when going to events page
2. **Second**: Check Network tab for API calls
3. **Third**: If API calls are successful, check the response format
4. **Fourth**: If no API calls, check authentication state

Let me know what you see in the browser console and I can help pinpoint the exact issue!
