# Supabase Feature Exploration Plan
*Comprehensive guide to exploring Supabase capabilities vs Microsoft Fabric SQL*

## 🎯 **Overview**
We'll explore Supabase features step-by-step, documenting each capability and comparing it with Microsoft Fabric SQL. Each step builds on the previous one.

---

## **Step 1: Real-time Subscriptions (WebSockets) 🔄**
### What is it?
**WebSockets** allow instant, two-way communication between your app and database. Instead of constantly asking "did anything change?" (polling), the database tells your app immediately when data changes.

**Example**: When someone asks a question in your AMA app, all other users see it instantly without refreshing.

### Supabase vs Fabric SQL
| Feature | Supabase | Microsoft Fabric SQL | Winner |
|---------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Real-time Updates** | ✅ Built-in WebSocket subscriptions | ❌ Not available (requires custom solution) | **Supabase** |
| **Setup Complexity** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ One line of code | ⭐⭐ Requires Django Channels + Redis | **Supabase** |
| **Performance** | Instant (<100ms) | N/A (would need custom implementation) | **Supabase** |

### What we'll build:
- Live question feed that updates instantly
- Real-time vote counters
- Live user count in events

---

## **Step 2: Built-in Authentication System 🔐**
### What is it?
Pre-built login/signup system with social providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) instead of building your own.

### Supabase vs Fabric SQL
| Feature | Supabase | Microsoft Fabric SQL | Winner |
|---------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Built-in Auth** | ✅ Email, social, magic links | ❌ Requires custom Django auth | **Supabase** |
| **Social Login** | ✅ Google, GitHub, Discord, etc. | ❌ Manual OAuth integration | **Supabase** |
| **Password Reset** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Custom implementation | **Supabase** |
| **Email Verification** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Custom SMTP setup | **Supabase** |
| **Microsoft Integration** | ⚠️ Possible but not native | ✅ Native Azure AD integration | **Fabric** |

### What we'll build:
- Google Sign-in for users
- Magic link authentication (passwordless)
- User profile management

## **Step 3: Auto-generated APIs 🤖**
### What is it?
Supabase automatically creates REST and GraphQL APIs from your database tables. No writing API endpoints manually!

### Supabase vs Fabric SQL
| Feature | Supabase | Microsoft Fabric SQL | Winner |
|---------|----------|---------------------|---------|

| **API Docs** | ✅ Auto-generated | ❌ Manual documentation | **Supabase** |
| **Custom Logic** | ⚠️ Limited to database functions | ✅ Full Python business logic | **Fabric** |

### What we'll explore:
- Direct frontend-to-database queries
- GraphQL for complex data fetching
- Compare performance vs Django APIs

---

## **Step 4: Row Level Security (RLS) 🛡️**
### What is it?
Database-level permissions that automatically filter data based on user identity. Users can only see/modify data they're allowed to.

### Supabase vs Fabric SQL

### What we'll build:
- Users only see their own events
- Moderators see all questions, users see public ones
- Automatic data filtering

---

## **Step 5: Edge Functions ⚡**
### What is it?
Serverless functions that run close to users worldwide. Like mini-programs that execute in the cloud.

### Supabase vs Fabric SQL
| Feature | Supabase | Microsoft Fabric SQL | Winner |
|---------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Serverless Functions** | ✅ Built-in Deno/TypeScript | ❌ Requires Azure Functions separately | **Supabase** |

### What we'll build:
- AI question summarization
- Email notifications
- Custom business logic

## **Step 6: Integrated File Storage 📁**
### What is it?
Built-in file storage with automatic image optimization and CDN delivery.

### Supabase vs Fabric SQL
| Feature | Supabase | Microsoft Fabric SQL | Winner |
|---------|----------|---------------------|---------|

## **📋 Execution Plan**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Start with Step 1** (Real-time subscriptions) - Most impressive and immediate
2. **Document results** after each step with performance comparisons
3. **Build incrementally** - each feature enhances the previous
4. **Test side-by-side** with Fabric SQL implementation
5. **Create feature comparison** documentation

### **Documentation Template:**
For each step, we'll create:
